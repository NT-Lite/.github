## What is NT Lite?

**NT Lite** is a powerful and comprehensive Windows image management tool designed for customization, optimization, and deployment. It allows users to modify Windows installation files (ISO/WIM) by removing unnecessary components, integrating updates, drivers, and applying various tweaks to enhance performance, security, and stability. Unlike standard installations, **NT Lite** enables the creation of a streamlined Windows environment tailored to specific needs, from gaming rigs to enterprise deployments.

With **NT Lite**, administrators and advanced users can achieve significant reductions in system footprint, faster boot times, and improved responsiveness by eliminating bloatware and disabling non-essential services. The software provides granular control over the Windows operating system, making it an indispensable utility for IT professionals, system builders, and enthusiasts who demand a clean, efficient, and personalized computing experience. Its intuitive interface guides users through the process of creating custom installation media, ensuring a repeatable and optimized setup every time.
